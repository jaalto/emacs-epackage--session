Description: save variables, registers and buffers across sessions

 To restore the variables, this package writes a session file
 (~/.session) when you exit Emacs. The file includes the values of
 variables which are automatically updated by Emacs during some
 editing operations:
 .
 - Histories of user input. For example, strings used in a
   find/replace command, names of files you have visited, etc.
 .
 - Contents of registers, whether they are texts or buffer/file
   positions. Buffer positions are automatically converted to file
   positions.
 .
 - List of recently copied/cut text blocks to paste, global markers to
   jump to, and other so-called rings.
 .
 - List of recently changed files with their places and some
   buffer-local variables
 .
 Note: 2022-01-20 the code hasn't been updated since 2016.
